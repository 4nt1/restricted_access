# RestrictedAccess

An access rights management tool.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'restricted_access', git: 'https://github.com/4nt1/restricted_access'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install restricted_access

## Usage

The gem is currently working only with Mongoid.

It depends on [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) & [mongoid-enum](https://github.com/thetron/mongoid-enum).


Generate this initializer with
```
rails g restricted_access:install admin --levels=mini normal super --controller_scope=backoffice
```

model_name is the name of the model concerned with the access restriction.

Give the available levels of access to the --levels options

Give your controllers scope name to the --controller_scope options (default: nil)

This will generate the restricted_access.rb initializer

```ruby
RestrictedAccess.configure do |config|

  config.accesses  = [ {  level:  :mini,
                          label:  'Some description for this access level',
                          power:  0 },
                        { level: :normal,
                          label: 'Some description for this access level',
                          power: 1 },
                        { level: :super,
                          label: 'Some description for this access level',
                          power:  2}
                      ]
  config.resource = :admin
  config.controller_scope = :backoffice

end
```

You can customize the accesses with a label (optional) and define different power (the higher has more rights).

The `config.resource` and `config.controller_scope` are useful only in Rails, defining some methods in controllers and helpers (see below).

### RestrictedAccess::Model

Include the RestrictedAccess::Model module in your related model

```ruby
class Admin
  include Mongoid::Document
  include RestrictedAccess::Model

end
```

The module enhances the model with some methods and attributes.

Every model has now a :level attribute (Symbol type), by default the first defined in your initializer. You can set it like any attributes.

```ruby
admin = Admin.first
admin.update(level: :super)

admin2 = Admin.last
admin.update(level: :mini)
```

The level defines its access rights.

Each instance has a `:access` method, returning a `RestrictedAccess::Access` instance.

```ruby
admin.access
=> #<RestrictedAccess::Access:0x007fc255d36098 @level=:super, @label="", @power=2>

```

The `RestrictedAccess::Access` class include comparable, so you can do such things :

```ruby
admin.access > admin2.access
=> true

RestrictedAccess.accesses.max
=> #<RestrictedAccess::Access:0x007fc255d36098 @level=:super, @label="", @power=2>

```

Thanks to the [mongoid-enum](https://github.com/thetron/mongoid-enum) gem, some methods to check rights.

```ruby
admin.mini?
=> false

admin.super?
=> true

Admin::LEVEL
=> [:mini, :normal, :super]

# scopes
Admin.mini # => Mongoid::Criteria
Admin.super # => Mongoid::Criteria
```

### RestrictedAccess::Controller

If you provided a `config.resource` and `config.controller_scope` in the initializer you can include the `RestrictedAccess::Controller` in your controller.

```ruby
class Backoffice::BaseController < ApplicationController
  include RestrictedAccess::Controller
end
```

Every inherited controller has now a few more methods:

* `:restrict_access`, which redirect to the `#{controller_scope}_root_path`. Set controller_scope to nil if you just want to redirect to root_path.

* `:prevent_#{level}_access`, which calls `:restrict_access` if the `:current_#{resource_name}` doesn't have enough access right. If you use Devise, you already have a `:current_#{resource_name}` method, if you don't use Devise, just implement it.

```ruby
class Backoffice::AdminsController < Backoffice::BaseController
  before_action :prevent_normal_access,  except: [:index]
  # mini & normal admins will only be able to access index view
end
```

### RestrictedAccess::Helper

```ruby
module Backoffice::AdminHelper
  include RestrictedAccess::Helper
end
```


If you provided a `config.resource` option, you can include the `RestrictedAccess::Helper` in one of your helpers.

It provides a `:available_for` method in the views, allowing you to hide some part of the view.

```html
<!-- this div won't be seen be admins lower than super -->
<%= available_for :super do %>
  <div>
    I have something to hide here.
  </div>
<%- end %>
```
